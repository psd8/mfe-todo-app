# Product Listing App

You can start this individual app via
yarn install
yarn start

we are using DragNDrop component which we exposed from our components lib

- one observation for this package found is when you swap last item with 1st item in draggable list so instead of interchanging the actual position result will be last item will be 1st and 1st item will be second and last second items will be last now, just found at the end of the testing and confirm with exa,ple mentioned in their git thread.
