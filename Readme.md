# Sticky Todo List With Re-arranging Feature

Here is the status of all 5 points mentioned in the PDF:

1. **Part1: Frontend**

   - Initial implementation done.
   - Improvisation needed folder structure for each MFE app.
   - Setup and wrote test cases.
   - Configured pre-commit hooks.

2. **Part2: Making Api Call**

   - Backend API creation (Not started yet).
   - Json server - started on this, but currently using static JSON file as I'm thinking to go with Python API.

3. **Part3: Trying it out!** (Not started yet)

4. **Part4: Deployment**

   - Mostly done and documented in the root README file with FE architecture and instructions on how to run and set up Docker Compose.
   - Production-related webpack configuration is pending.

5. **Part 5: General questions** (Not started yet)

## Architecture

### Backend

- JSON API
- Python API

### Frontend

- MicroFrontend using Module Federation
- Docker for containerizing each individual app, running all apps in a single go using Docker Compose

#### Components

- Contains individual components or small micro-frontend projects that run independently and are exposed for consumption by the host app.

#### Host Apps (product-listing)

- A standalone SPA React app that consumes MFE components exposed via Module Federation. Considered alternatives like NX workspace for monorepo benefits, but opted for Module Federation due to the project's size.

### Docker Compose

- Used for deployment and running individual MFE containers as well as the backend API.

## How to Run the Project

### Frontend

#### Prerequisites

- Navigate to the `frontend`, `product-listing`, and `components` folders and run `npm install` or `yarn install` to install the required npm modules.
- Install Docker Desktop, Docker, and Docker Compose.
- Start Docker Desktop or the Docker daemon.

#### Running the Project

1. **Docker Compose**

   - **Development Environment**:

     ```sh
     docker-compose up --build
     ```

     This command runs all the micro-frontend apps with the host app. Access them via `localhost:8082` and `localhost:8083`.

   - **Production Environment**:

     ```sh
     docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up
     ```

2. **Via npm Scripts**

   - First, go to the `dragndrop-component` directory and run:

     ```sh
     yarn start
     ```

   - Then, go to the `product-listing` app directory and run:

     ```sh
     yarn start
     ```

     **Note**: Ensure all remote apps consumed by the host app are up and running. Check the `webpack.config` Module Federation configuration for details on which apps need to be running.

### Adjustments Made:

- Clarified the status of each project part.
- Improved section headings for readability.
- Emphasized key points and added notes for clarity.

This should enhance the readability and usability of your README.md file. Adjust as necessary based on specific project details or additional requirements!
